Wind me up
Put me down
Start me off and watch me go
I'll be running circles around
you sooner than you know
A little off center
And im out of tune
Just kickin this can
along the avenue
But im alright
Coz it's easy once you
know how it's done
You can't stop now
It's already begun
You feel it
Running through your bones
And you jerk it out
Jerk it out
Shut up
Hush your mouth
Can't you hear you
talk to loud
No I can't hear nothing cause
I got my head up in the clouds
I bite off anything that I
can chew
I'm chasing cars up and down
the avenue
But that's ok
Coz it's easy
once you know how it's done
You can't stop now
It's already begun
You feel it
Running through your bones
When you jerk it out
Coz it's easy
once you know how it's done
You can't stop now
It's already begun
You feel it
Running through your bones
When you jerk it out
When you jerk it out
When you jerk it out
Oh baby don't you know you
Really gotta jerk it out
When you jerk it out
Oh baby don't you know you
Really gotta jerk it out
When you jerk it out
Oh baby don't you know you
Really gotta jerk it out
